# How it started

Part of the source code, especially the backend source code, comes from my previous web project:

# Want to contribute?

I know this is a tough time for everyone, so I welcome anyone with an interest in web development to contribute to this project. I will be pleased to do some code reviews when needed.

If you don't know where to start, I highly recommend you watch this video from  Patrick God: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtthbiP3SE0. I have a great appreciation for his tutorials and have gained a significant amount of knowledge, even after completing coding bootcamp with a top grade.

If you want to chat, you can find my contact information on my profile page. That's it; please enjoy!
